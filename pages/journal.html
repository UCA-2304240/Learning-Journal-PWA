                            When editing the respiratory, one difficulty I encountered was switching GitHub
                            credentials, as my credentials were still the ones of my previous GitHub account. The
                            solution
                            was simple in that one simply switches an account in VScode, what is confusing at that time
                            was
                            that I thought the credentials had something to do with git, and then started looking deeply
                            into
                            git.
                            Another difficulty along the way was hosting the web app using PythonAnywhere. Since
                            the code given by the link is a static site, meaning there’s no app.py, so I had to add a
                            static
                            directory under static files to host this static site.

                            Mobile First Design is practiced by constanly checking the design in mobile size.
                            However, since the original template was made for laptop, therefore mobile adaptations
                            exist in media queries. Furthermore, instead of using orientation, this website queries
                            width, making it possible to display more info on high res phones.
                            <Br>
                            One useful concept of CSS applied is display type grid. I recently found it to be
                            more flexible than the flexbox when it comes to making responsive UI. With flexbox,
                            one would need to tweak the flex for each size individually for each element,
                            which makes it hard to maintain.
                            <Br>
                            Throughout this lab, one challenge would sure be dealing with responsive UI.
                            One had to think of one design in two ways. For example when using grid,
                            one had to design it with the potential to adapt to mobile, thus extra
                            grid-template-columns when that column is actually not used in the current
                            working device size.

                            I mainly use querySelector as it uses css selectors. It makes it easier to refractor
                            styles as one don't have to recall whether they used getElementBy(ID/Class).
                            <Br>
                            The most challenging part when it comes to linking javascript to html would be
                            the DOM Manipulation. There is many methods, like setting innerHTML, append,
                            insertAdjacentHTML...

                            To debug javscript, I maninly use console.log to find where the value start to
                            go wrong. However, since currently the code is simple, i can go directly to
                            the error by seeing the line count in the null reference error.

                            I chose local storage, fetch, and Youtube API. Local storage is for things like
                            theme customizations, fetch is for syncing files that might be updated often
                            on ther server, and the youtube player to play music.
                            <Br>
                            For local storage, I decided to use it for a client customised message. To avoid
                            the huge style difference when using &ltinput I tried the contenteditable attribute,
                            however it won't trigger the change event. Therefore I used the &lttextarea>, as it has
                            less differeniation from &ltdiv>.
                            <Br>
                            For Fetch, I initially decided to use it for fetching journal entries, however a
                            major issue was that json did not supported multiline strings, thus in consideration
                            of maitainability, this functionality was forfeited.
                            <Br>
                            For the Youtube API, I used code I written before, and the biggest challenge was
                            recalling what I did before, as I had two versions, one uses Audio API to play
                            mp3 url links, while one is styled differently and uses Youtube API. Also, the
                            fact that onYouTubeIframeAPIReady() is not called every refresh is also quite
                            misleading.

                            By using a json file, data is stored on the server then fetched by the client. This 
                            helps with keeping the data up to date. To modify these json files with python, one
                            would use python json package. In the PWA, a random token is generated in a python script,
                            then put into the syncInfo.json, only to be fetched on loading of index.html by index.js
                            to replace the token of the day bar.
